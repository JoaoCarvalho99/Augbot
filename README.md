### Description of ROS nodes

- `UWB_Reader`: Read data from DWM1001 sensor and publishes to `/UWB`.
- `uwb_simulation`: Subscribe to `/tf` to simulate UWB ranges and publishes to `/UWB`.
- `IMU_Reader`: Read data from IMU sensor and publishes to `/IMU`.
- `deadReckoning`: Subscribe to `/IMU` and... estimates de position and publishes to `/deadReckoning`.
- `least_squares`: Subscribe to `/UWB` and estimates de position and publishes to `/leastSquares`.
- `AlphaBot2_Control`: Control the robot movement in the simulation and publishes to `/alphabot2/control`.
- `writeRosbag`: Log data from ROStopics to ROSbags.
- `mqttBridge`: Send data from ROStopics to outside of the system through MQTT.


### Description of ROS Topics:

- `topic name`: funcao, `msg type`
